# stoccer


This is a personal project. The main ideia is to create a fantasy stock market linked to the real soccer world.

This will only work if you have a Android/IOS Simulator installed. (Only tested for IOS with Xcode)
You have to have React Native installed. If you do not have it yet, follow these steps https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html


After cloned the project, open its folder `cd stoccer`, then run `npm install` to install some dependencies.

<br><br>

By now you just got to run the app.
Use `react-native run-ios` if you want to open the IOS version, or `react-native run-android` if you prefer the Android version.
